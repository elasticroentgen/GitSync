There's tests for invalid signatures but there are a few cases with public keys worth testing:\r\n\r\n1. An unparsable public key e.g. `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\r\n2. The infinite public key `0xc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\r\n3. A public key that's not part of the g1 group\r\n\r\n",
