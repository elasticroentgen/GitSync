[x] Withdrawable 0x01 validators -> withdrawn (at epoch boundaries) and core withdrawal mechanism -- #2836 \r\n2. [x] 0x00 -> 0x01 withdrawal credentials change operation -- #2855 \r\n3. [x] Partial withdrawal on amounts above 32 eth for 0x01 validators -- #2862 \r\n4. [ ] consider removal of `withdrawn_epoch` added in (1)\r\n     * zero some fields\r\n     * place behind a function `is_fully_withdrawn()`\r\n     * still track how long it's been since fully withdrawn to know if \"safe\" to reuse validator slot\r\n         * we often think it \"safe\" to reuse a validator slot if it is *firmly* outside of upper bounds of WS period. For example, 3x a best-case 4-month WS period -> 1 year\r\n6. [ ] consider deposits into withdrawn validators (if pubkeys don't get zeroed out)\r\n\r\nWill check the above when the base PRs are merge in for each (rather than once perfection has been reached",
