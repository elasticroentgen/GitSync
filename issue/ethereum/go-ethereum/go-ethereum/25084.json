  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `v1.10.18`\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu LTS 20.04\r\nCommit hash : Stable v1.10.18\r\n\r\nAdditional specs: 16 GB RAM, 1.5TB SSD & 6 vCPUs\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nRun `geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/chain --syncmode \"full\" --cache=16000` after which the node slowly and steady syncs till the last few hundred blocks where it starts with state entries \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nI ran `geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/chain --syncmode \"full\" --cache=16000` after which the first 2.3 million blocks went really fast, then the DOS attack (block 2.3m->block 2.7m) happened which slowed it heavily down. You would expect that after that it would speed up again but after reaching 3 million it has only been processing 10 blocks per second, I'm currently at 4.6M blocks and that has taken me 2 days, while the first 2 million blocks took me 3 hours.  \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nRun `geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/chain --syncmode \"full\" --cache=16000`\r\n\r\nWait a few hours till you're at 2.3 million, it'll slow down to only a very few blocks per second (if any at all).\r\n12-15 hours later you're at 2.75 million blocks, it speeds up again to ~100 bps\r\nHit 3 million after which it slows down till an unknown block (1-10 bps steady)\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n`INFO [06-14|06:48:32.726] Unindexing transactions                  blocks=1000 txs=6584  total=2048 elapsed=2.389s`\r\n`INFO [06-14|06:48:37.370] Unindexed transactions                   blocks=2048 txs=14152 tail=2,176,792 elapsed=7.033s`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what I see every 10-20 seconds on my console, which I did not see earlier, rest looks normal (just importing new chain segment 1-10 blcks each time it pops up & deep froze chain segment, but thats all normal as far as I know) \r\n\r\nI already tried to use another version, but this did only temporarily speed it up after which it slowed down extremely again.",
