    "body": "There were two things that came up in https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/581 where CL teams' feedback is necessary to unblock things on 4844:\r\n1. Whether the `Blob gasprice update rule` in the EIP should optimize for stable throughput or \"bursts\" of blobs ([context](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5353#issuecomment-1199277606))\r\n2. Whether blob syncing should be tightly coupled to block syncing. Long term, the desire is to decouple these, but this adds implementation complexity and, given the low number of blobs expected with EIP-4844, it might be best to sync blobs along with their associated blocks. \r\n\r\nIf time permits, it'd be great to discuss both these things.",
