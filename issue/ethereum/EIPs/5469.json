I wanted to start with the basics (typos). What is going on? What should I do?\r\nby @0fatih new contributor who intend to help and learn by proposing a small typo fix.\r\n \r\nBy changing the EIPW to only check modified to make it easier for contributor to contribute. \r\n\r\nException: If some new editorial rule is important enough to be enforced *immediately*, it's probably worthy of a batch clean up across EIPs before EIPW start to enforcing this new rule.",
