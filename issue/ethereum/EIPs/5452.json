It is the permission assigned to the @ethereum/eip-editors group (and that group is how I propose the permission to be given).\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Turns the editor approvals into green checkmarks and editor requests for changes into red checklists (much clearer for the user)\r\n- Allows editors to assign / remove labels\r\n- Allows editors to close spam PRs\r\n- Allows me to potentially transfer issues to the EIP-Bot repository if they crop up here and belong there.\r\n- Allows editors to be requested for review\r\n- **Due to branch protection, does not allow manual merging.**\r\n- **Due to branch protection, does not allow directly committing.**\r\n- **Does not allow editing settings, or other sensitive stuff.**",
