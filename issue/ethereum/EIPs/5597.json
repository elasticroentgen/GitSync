  "body": "### Proposed Change\r\n\r\nDear editors, here is an [example of comment](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5593/files#r962979171) that I like to suggest against:\r\n\r\n> No external links\r\n\r\nThere is nothing personal, I am just trying to voice suggestion against such editorial practice.\r\n\r\nI suggest EIP editors avoid leaving a simple comment like this above, especially towards new authors who don't necessarily know how to challenge editorial comment. \r\n\r\nPlease note that, per \r\nEIP-1 shows the current policy in EIP-1\r\n> Links to external resources SHOULD NOT be included. External resources may disappear, move, or change unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nWhich is \"SHOULD NOT\" but not \"MUST NOT\" pursuant to RFC 2729\r\nPlease kindly allow authors to understand it's ok for them to include links when necessary given the current policy.\r\n\r\nI am making it a EIP issue so I can easily reference in other of my comments.\r\n\r\nI also think it's good for an Editor to set a good example about following EIP-1, and about understanding of \"SHOULD\" vs \"MUST\" in their editorial contributions\r\n\r\nFYI: @axic, @Pandapip1,  @gcolvin, @lightclient, @SamWilsn if my understanding of the current policy is incorrect.",

    "body": "Here's an argument to advocate for the less restrictive approach. \r\n\r\nI think there's major advantages to being able to reference other works externally and my interpretation of SHOULD NOT was that unless there's good reason to externally link, such as to reference another spec that's being normatively linked to, then it \"should not\" be done.\r\n\r\nIf the intent is to never externally link then this language should probably be updated to \"MUST NOT\".\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think should not is the right call here if you're intending to standardize technical specifications. I believe this is the intent with something like \"standards track\" available.\r\n\r\nMany organizations like ISO/NIST/W3C/IRTF/IETF/OASIS are able to achieve good practices of linking as well for standards too, so I don't believe this is an impossible task.\r\n\r\nWith those considerations in mind, I would say there's good intention that this repository is not meant to contribute proprietary designs, IP encumbered material to create moats for for profit companies, or turn it into a thinly veiled sales tactic for companies to design a piece of technology and promote it through EIP standards. That kind of defeats the purpose of a standard in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo I do believe there should be limitations here, but I don't think saying no links strikes the right balance here.\r\n\r\nHere's some ideas of how we might be able to solve this.\r\n\r\n1. Use reference links so it's easier to spot broken links\r\n\r\n2. Allow a select set of URLs that can be trusted to maintain documents for long periods of time like SDOs to be linked.\r\n\r\n3. otherwise require the web page to be snapshot and linked through the internet archive time machine or pinned to IPFS maybe.",

    "body": "> Let me summarize the points as I understand them from both sides.\r\n> \r\n> More restrictive:\r\n> \r\n> * Links might rot or change contents\r\n>   \r\n>   * Pretty bad case: An expired domain is bought by a scammer, and we send users directly into a phishing scam\r\n> * Links can just be ommited\r\n>   \r\n>   * If need be, they can be placed in the assets folder\r\n>     \r\n>     * Could even be done by a bot automagically\r\n> * EIPs should only ever depend on information in the EIPs repository\r\n>   \r\n>   * Imagine if EIP-20 required you to read Adam Smith's The Invisible Hand\r\n> * Links would have to be `nofollow` to comply with Google search policies and other standards\r\n>   \r\n>   * Requires a custom Jekyll renderer\r\n> \r\n> Less restrictive:\r\n> \r\n> * Easier to write an EIP\r\n> * Adds context that might otherwise be missing\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this @Pandapip1 . I think it's a great way to coverage to a consensus. \r\n\r\nI started a collaborative note\r\nhttps://hackmd.io/@pghfB_fJTlKAKoeedJTRPQ/rJtbjVExs based on your note and I put the arguments there. Can I invite you to continue to contribute to this notes? \r\n\r\nThe plan is that I am hoping once we collected sufficient arguments of both side, we turn it into an informative EIP as \"EIP Reference Best Practice / Policy\"",
