    "body": "The way I currently interpret `required` is that the specification requires another EIP in order to be fully read/understood.  This would be useful if one wanted to archive a single EIP, you would also need to traverse through every referenced EIP as well and archive them, else the EIP would be incomplete.\r\n\r\nI'm not against renaming the field, but I am weakly against (open to discussion) adding a separate second field.  I suspect a lot of people read the `required` field from the context of writing an interface, where their interface has a dependency on some other interface.  However, many EIPs don't have that type of dependency and the `requires` only is meant to indicate that the reader will need to read some other things as well to fully understand the specification or its supplemental data.",

    "body": "Yes, it does if we make EIPW required.  😀  That being said, I still think there is value in putting all referenced EIPs in the `required` field because it encourages authors to reference as little external stuff (even other EIPs) as possible, and nudges them away from wanting to include a history lesson in their standards.\r\n\r\nMany authors have a bunch of material in their motivation/rationale that basically reduces to \"I don't like the 15 other standards, so I am writing a 16th standard that is better\".  Ideally, authors would write a useful standard in isolation and leave that sort of text for a blog post, autobiography, or made-for-TV movie about the life of the author.",

    "body": "One thing I'll add about this is that the main reason to not have external links in the EIPs is because we want to make the EIP editor role as easy as possible and not require judgement about every link in an EIP. IMO this proposal adds this level of overhead to editor's role, and adds way less value than allowing (high quality) external links (e.g. only links to the EL/CL specs). If we do have an \"EIP editor judgement/complexity\" budget, I'd much rather we spend it on a good policy around external links. Just my 2 gwei :-) ",
