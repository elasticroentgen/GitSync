(I can see this in the CI bots' notices.)\r\n\r\nThat's fine and I respect your control of this naming.\r\n\r\nBefore I go around telling everybody that ERC-721 is now renamed to EIP-721, it will be helpful if the EIP official documentation does not contradict me. Please do these:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/README.md to use this new wording\r\n- [ ] Make a blog post documenting this significant change and link to it prominently from the README and EIP-1\r\n\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_",
