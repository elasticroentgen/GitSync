([beta version link](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/code))\r\nHowever, we're hopeful that the Remix IDE will include Rust grammar/syntax checking as well as these other networks often use Rust to construct contracts.\r\nThe Monaco editor of the Remix IDE will thus have a Rust language server integrated into it. \r\nIf Remix IDE supports Rust, there will be a variety of Rust-based plugins accessible.\r\nCan we be permitted to contribute by creating this component?\r\n\r\nYour opinion is needed on Remix IDE's graceful transition to a multi-chain IDE!",
