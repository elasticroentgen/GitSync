  "body": "It is currently possible to select a specific compiler version by specifying it in the URL but as far as I can tell the value has to exactly match one of the binaries available in solc-bin. For example: https://remix.ethereum.org?version=soljson-v0.7.6+commit.7338295f.js.\r\n\r\nI'd like to include compiler version in Remix links that are going to be added to Solidity docs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11415). The problem is that knowing the specific commit requires downloading and processing the list of binaries while docs are being generated and this makes the whole process much more complex. It would be great if version could be specified as something like `version=0.7.6` and Remix would choose the binary matching that version.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple matching binaries, it does not matter much which one is chosen (as long as the same one is chosen consistently) since the only cases like this are either ones symlinked to make naming consistent and ones rebuilt to match the right tagged commit in the repo.",
