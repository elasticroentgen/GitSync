    "body": "Hey @joshuahannan !\r\n\r\nDo you have any preferred way of providing that information?\r\nIMHO we could receive that information as part of the LSP handshake. Thanksfully the client initiates the initialize call and there one could simply say what it supports (or in other words(!): what it wants us to support), using the capabilities field. If the client only advertises semanticTokens, for example, we could respone the initialize handshake with a capabilities field that also only advertises semantic tokens support - effectively making sure that all the other features are in fact responding with \"Method not supported\" (forgot the actual code naming, but you get the point).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Forgot to ask how that can help you on the vscode-solidity side. I am curious :)",

    "body": "> to load the solcjs and proxy the calls depending on the compiler version, and what is supported.\r\n\r\nAgreed. If we get the native passing through first, I'd highly like that, and then I hope we can focus on solcjs again. Having solcjs exposing LSP is pretty high on the table. I just hope I'll find someone knowledgeable here to pair with me on that in one way or another. :)",
