There is still one edge, case, though: If you compile a file that does not contain any contracts, it still does not output anything. We should report something like 'input did not contain any contracts'. We should also check what happens if contracts are present but are abstract or interfaces.",

    "body": "This issue actually requires some clarification. It was originally reported while #4525 was still in progress, probably with the assumption that it will be merged but in the end it wasn't. Instead we merged #4958 some time after that and it apparently solved the issue differently because now compiler always prints `Compiler run successful, no output requested.` when there's no other output. The message is not always correct though because it can be displayed even if user did request some outputs.\r\n\r\nAs for the case when there are only abstract contracts or interfaces present - the output is non-empty so the problem does not exist - the compiler prints a header describing the type of output and the contract name (though the latter not for all outputs).\r\n\r\nSo, here's what needs to actually be done:\r\n1. When there are no contracts at all in the input, say just that instead of saying that no outputs were requested.\r\n2. When there are only abstract contracts and interfaces to compile, there's no change required.\r\n    - We might want to print a message saying that there were no deployable contracts but that might actually be a breaking change (do we consider changes like that to console output breaking?). We would also have to handle different outputs differently. For example such contracts can still have some output in `--hashes` or `--devdoc` even if `--bin` is empty. But I think it's better to leave this case up to #12398 I have just reported.\r\n3. I'd change the message displayed in all other cases to `Compiler run successful, no output.`. Optionally, we could actually check if any outputs were requested and print a more specific message in that case.\r\n4. Consistently print the header with contract name in all cases (i.e. the `======= test.sol:C =======` part). Currently `--ir`, `--ir-optimized`, `--ewasm` do not print it when used on their own.",
