  "body": "# FEATURE REQUEST\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe `require` are very helpful and easy to understand, but the problem with `require` statements is that they store a string as an error message. And strings are not much gas optimized. To make the contract gas optimized we use custom errors within `if-else` statements. Which are not quite sometimes easy to understand especially when they get rooted in.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI think we can solve this problem by making `Require` statements revert `Custom Error` instead of string.\r\nCheck This:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nerror Owner__ChorChorChor();\r\n\r\ncontract Owner {\r\n    address public owner = msg.sender;\r\n\r\n    function newOwner(address _newOwner) public OnlyOwner {\r\n        owner = _newOwner;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    modifier OnlyOwner { //Instead of this \r\n        require(owner == msg.sender, \"Chor! Chor! Chor!\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    modifier OnlyOwner { // this would be perfect\r\n        require(owner == msg.sender, revert Owner__ChorChorChor(); );\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIDk C++, I wish I could make a PR with this functionality.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n",
