The search result seems to be from `develop`, which our `robots.txt` block. We only allow `latest`, `v0.7.6` and latest release. The question is - why is `develop` still getting indexed (and appears in results before those other allowed versions) if we blocked it?",

For example searching for `solidity revert` I get this:\r\n\r\n![solidity-revert-google-search-2022-07-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/179479547-2ee34564-f5e9-487b-95a8-c24983918d0c.png)\r\n\r\nThe upper result is from 0.8.13 while the lower one is for 0.8.15. I think we're seeing different results because Google has all versions still indexed and you can get hits from ones that are disallowed in `robots.txt` and ones that are allowed, depending on what you search for.\r\n\r\nSo the question would be how to stop Google from returning results from blocked versions and return newer ones instead. I wonder if it's actually possible - we assumed that blocking them in `robots.txt` would remove them from search completely but maybe that's not how it works.",
