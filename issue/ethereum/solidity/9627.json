    "body": "Here's the gist of my discussion with @ekpyron on Gitter:\r\n\r\nThe reason that the stack compressor and the `g` and `fDnTOc g` parts are hard-coded is that it's just final cleanup and we don't want them to disappear when we use a sequence produced by yul-phaser. This part is not meant to be evaluated using the same criteria as the rest of the sequence (i.e. just taking the size of the resulting code into account).\r\n\r\nIf Stack Compressor is safe to use at arbitrary points in the sequence (it does not have to be effective but must not crash the compiler), it could be assigned a letter and treated as any other step. I just didn't see any practical need for doing it like that and decided to keep it simple. It would need a tiny wrapper to make it accept the same parameters as other steps and the phaser would also need a special case to ignore the Stack Compressor step. Then the hard-coded part could be made a part of the main sequence.\r\n\r\nWe would just need to document that the cleanup part and the compressor should be included when using a custom sequence. Or, for better usability, it might be best to have two separate options: one to change the first part of the sequence (meant to optimize size) and the other to change the final cleanup. It would make it easier to override one without having to change the other. Having phaser actually treat it like two sequences and use different criteria is actually something that came up in my discussions with @chriseth while I was working on it.\r\n\r\nSo implementing it is not a problem, it's just a matter of deciding how configurable we want/need it to be.",

    "body": "> BTW, can you say more about how it relates to Homestead? I don't know much about that.\r\n\r\nThe new code transform is incompatible with homestead, so we use the optimized version of the old code transform for it - and depending on the code transform it's better to call the stack compressor at different stages (the stack compressor is intertwined with the code transform - the code transform basically tells it which variables it should try to eliminate - for the old code transform that works rather heuristically, for the new one it's a very specific minimal set of variables and further steps afterwards may break things again)\r\n\r\nBut, actually, homestead is only one of two cases in which we run the stack compressor early - the second one is optimized compilation with disabled stack optimization - although I'm not sure that's a reasonable setting we want to keep.\r\n\r\nWe need to think about how to deal with this in the future - maintaining those separate paths right now is a bit unfortunate, but we haven't decided what to do yet.",

Anyone actually using it will lose some optimizer steps, possibly without even realizing it.\r\n\r\nBut I have another idea: how about introducing some kind of prefix that will be required to enable the new behavior (for example `--yul-optimizations @fDnTOcg`) and keeping the current behavior by default until 0.9? Then we'd have no issues with breakage, silent or not.",
