[example](https://github.com/flockonus/eth-denver-2019/blob/master/contract/contracts/City.sol#L225-L285), it's clearly undesirable.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have flags that can be active only during development deployments, and not during production for logging events, for instance. Or balancing game mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn my mind it would also be similar to [c macros](https://www.quora.com/What-are-macros-in-C) in addition of taking an env var to define the mode / network it's being deployed to",
