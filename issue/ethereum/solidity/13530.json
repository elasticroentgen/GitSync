  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure why this is happening but it seems memory writes do not happen in one of my functions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I include console logs from hardhat the writes start to take effect.\r\n\r\nThis happens with or without compiler optimisations enabled.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/pull/452/commits/022adea41d0c891bf8d92c117bcc4a18fb98278f\r\n\r\nremoving this\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/actions/runs/3061601203/jobs/4941572318#step:4:400\r\n\r\ncauses this test to fail, which means that it is not writing a value to memory that it is looking for when it tries to read it back\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/pull/452/commits/c967e0d3d64eca79777f2040ce6482b1487cb402\r\n\r\ndisabling optimiser doesn't help\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/actions/runs/3061791728/jobs/4941999523\r\n\r\ntest still fails\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/pull/452/commits/c0c20e92df01a139436d5a19309aab75376cf254\r\n\r\nadding console log fixes the test\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/actions/runs/3061817876/jobs/4942058769\r\n\r\nthis passes now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.15 and 0.8.17 tested\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: mac/linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI don't have a minimum reproduction because it seems like some low level yul issue that i have never seen before, i've been calling this `eval` function many times in many different places and never noticed this before.\r\n\r\nvery open to debugging ideas, it's difficult to debug given the console log makes the bug disappear\r\n",
