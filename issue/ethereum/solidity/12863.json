Original issue reported in the Hardhat repo at https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2433\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.0\r\n- Framework/IDE: Hardhat 2.8.4\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAfter compiling the following contract, I don't see the integer array `ids` as part of the generated ABI in `artifacts/contracts/Example.sol/Example.json`, neither as part of the mapping `mappedData` nor in the top-level struct field `data`.\r\n```solidity\r\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Example {\r\n    struct Data {\r\n        uint256[] ids;\r\n        uint256 createdAt;\r\n        address user;\r\n    }\r\n    mapping (uint256 => Data) public mappedData;\r\n    Data public data;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFWIW I have also tried with a different type of nested array ( `address[]`) and it also has the same issue so it doesn't look type-specific.\r\n\r\ncc @alcuadrado",
