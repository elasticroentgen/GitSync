  "body": "https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12615 reported a serious error in our override logic.\r\nWhile https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616 fixes the issue, we realized that our strict override logic has some counterintuitive implications, namely https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797992050 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635.\r\n\r\nSo we intend to relax our override requirements to avoid cases like that.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we want to have a specification with the following property:\r\n -   Each direct base of a contract can contribute at most one base function to the override requirements of a function.\r\n\r\nIn particular consider the following situation:\r\n```\r\ninterface I { function f() external; }\r\ncontract A is I { function f() external {} }\r\ncontract B is I { }\r\ncontract C is A, B {\r\n  // no override is required here!\r\n}\r\ncontract D is C {\r\n  // The following *should* be valid, but currently fails and requires \"override(I, A)\".\r\n  function f() external override // more specifically \"override(A)\"\r\n  {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to relax the override requirements, s.t. ``D`` in the example becomes valid.\r\nHowever, this is breaking (since currently specifying more bases than required is an error).\r\nSo more specifically, we want to do this change while allowing additional bases (with a warning) in 0.8, while those additional bases will become an error only in 0.8.\r\n\r\nSo this issue has two parts:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Relax the override requirements while allowing the bases that were previously required with a warning (non-breaking).\r\n- [ ] Disallow the additional bases we warned about in the next breaking release (breaking).\r\n\r\n",
