  "body": "The first batch of the issue management changes from [Issue labeling guidelines (proposal)](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/SkMG8szAq).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add the labels we decided that we want for now:\r\n    - Effort: `epic`, `high effort`, `medium effort`, `low effort`.\r\n    - Impact: `high impact`, `medium impact`, `low impact`.\r\n    - Desirability: `roadmap`, `must have`, `must have eventually`, `should have`, `nice to have`.\r\n    - Task type: `refactor`, `bug`, `documentation`, `research`, `testing`.\r\n- [x] Delete `feature` and `enhancement` labels (remove them from all issues).\r\n- [ ] Choose sensible colors. My suggestion would be to have the same base color for each category with a lighter shade for `low` and darker for `high`. Feel free to adjust some of the existing colors if they clash. There are some that are what they are for a good reason (`bug`=red, `codegen error`=black, etc.) but most of them were chosen ad-hoc.\r\n- [ ] Make sure that `solc-js` has these labels too. For now I'd not synchronize the others, just add the ones that are missing and adjust colors if they're not the same.\r\n- [ ] Remove `feature` label from the link in [`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml) (this is the config for [the template chooser](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/new/choose)).\r\n- [ ] Add an entry to [the template chooser](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/new/choose) for opening a new forum discussion in the right category. We decided not to have the `controversial` label, so I think we need to more strongly encourage people to post their wilder ideas on the forum first and only open feature requests for them after getting some feedback.\r\n- [ ]  Consider also tweaking the [`feature_request.md` template](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to mention the forum.",
