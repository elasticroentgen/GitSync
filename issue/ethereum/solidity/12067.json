  "body": "There is currently support for `verbatim`, allowing to instert arbitrary bytecode, but only when compiling in strict assembly mode. But the `verbatim` group of functions ios not available inside `assembly` blocks in Solidity code. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction f() {\r\n\tassembly {\r\n\t\tverbatim_0i_0o(hex\"c0\")\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiling with `solc`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Function \"verbatim_0i_0o\" not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the motivation for disabling verbatim in Solidity? I understand that it must be used with care and only for very specific reasons. My use case is that I am targetting a forked version of the EVM interpreter with new opcodes. I'm currently unable to use `solc` to compile contracts targetting this fork.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "For now it's a proof of concept, and it's not even clear that this approach is the correct one.\r\n\r\nWe want to add support for Solidity as a language for an experimental language-agnostic smart contracts platform. We don't need or want to emulate a whole Ethereum blockchain, since our smart contracts run in level 2; we only need to run the Solidity code and store the current state. What we need is some way to bridge the Solidity code with the underlying sandbox; and for that one idea is to add some custom opcodes, like some form of \"syscalls\", like \"obtain the chain ID\" or \"publish an event\". Again, maybe there is a better approach but for now we are experimenting with this.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

This means that if the Yul optimizer is enabled, then `verbatim` has to be used with extreme caution. We assume that users of pure Yul already are in a position to make this judgement (we have added some example situations that would lead to undefined behaviour: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#verbatim).\r\n\r\nWe can of course allow it in Solidity's inline assembly. The question is if the Yul optimizer should be completely disabled or partly; if partly, which ones? It would be useful if you can give a list of additional opcodes that you would like to add this way, to get an idea of how this would work for your case.",

    "body": "We are still evaluating options, so we haven't settled on what the opcodes will look like exactly. But an example would be something very simple to retrieve a value from the context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet x := verbatim_0i_1o(hex\"c1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the return value is provided by our sandbox; for example the (non-ethereum) address of the contract creator.\r\n\r\n@chriseth I was not aware that `solc --ir` actually produced Yul code. It looks like this could be useful for our use case. I'll explore this approach. I think we can close this issue for now. Thanks!",

    "body": "looking forward to this! so why not just do analysis on the ops to ensure no stack manipulation deeper than the \"inputs\" in the verbatim name & ensures that only 1 element is added to the stack at the end? if you have that guarantee + memory safety, while you dont get \"full\" mutability of the execution context, you do get a decent ways safely\r\n\r\nif you want to enable this sort of check maybe something like: `assembly (\"memory-safe stack-safe\") { verbatim_1i_1o(<pop, push(1) ops>, a}`\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't have stack-safe all bets are off on optimizations? Here it would be trivial to look op by op and ensure its stack safe, and if you break the safety contract there is a compiler error. And you can also easily run an analysis to check that storage purity in solidity matches verbatim opcodes. I think at this low level its fine to force users to enumerate the safety they are guaranteeing the compiler, i.e. one could imagine:\r\n\r\n`assembly (\"memory-safe stack-safe jumpless storage-pure\")` etc. \r\n\r\nTo be clear I am not as knowledgeable on the compiler as y'all obviously, just my 2 cents\r\n\r\n",
