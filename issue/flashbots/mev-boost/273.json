  "body": "Currently users are required to make a binary choice between using a centralized block builder or forgoing MEV.\r\n\r\nMEV-Boost should allow user's to set a fixed fee (e.g. 0.2 ETH) under which they will use a locally produced block.\r\n\r\nIn this way validators can gain exposure to large MEV opportunities while still contributing to decentralized block building when MEV is small/non existent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as the CL does not currently have a view into the value of a locally produced block, this provides some protection to user's from relay's producing very low value blocks.\r\n\r\nIn the future this can be enhanced by comparing the value of the locally built block vs. the remote builder's submission and using a fee delta instead of a fixed fee.\r\n\r\nOriginally submitted as an issue to a few CLs but it was suggested that it would be better to implement it in MEV-Boost.\r\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/6140\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3517",
