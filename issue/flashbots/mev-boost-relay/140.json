    "body": "> What makes you think this is a violation of the AGPL?\r\n\r\nNormally authors retain the copyright to their works. They grant a license for the open source project to use and integrate and redistribute the work – typically the license grant is extended to the public. In a sufficiently distributed copyright model, it is very hard to change a license, as all copyright holders would need to agree.  However with this current CLA it ensures that the project owner has all needed rights to use, protect, redistribute … the code. If the CLA contains copyright assignment (which it does) this  also allows the project to change the license or to create derived works under a different license. AGPL restricts changing of the license to only future subset of A/GPL licenses. \r\n\r\n",
